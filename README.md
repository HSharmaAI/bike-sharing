# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project! Our goal is to build a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes. This model will help us understand the factors influencing bike demand, providing BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, with valuable insights to strategize and boost revenue, especially in the post-COVID-19 world.

## Project Background

BoomBikes has faced a significant revenue drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and plan for the future, they need to grasp the factors that drive bike-sharing demand. This project is designed to achieve that by:

1. **Data Preparation and Exploration**: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for effective analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Model Building**: Developing a multiple linear regression model to predict bike demand.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance and analyzing the residuals.

## Dataset

Our dataset includes daily bike demand information with various features such as:

- **Season**: Categorical (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- **Weather Situation**: Categorical (Clear, Mist, Light Snow, Heavy Rain)
- **Temperature**: Continuous
- **Humidity**: Continuous
- **Windspeed**: Continuous
- **Holiday**: Binary
- **Working Day**: Binary
- **Year**: Binary (0: 2018, 1: 2019)
- **Month**: Categorical
- **Weekday**: Categorical
- **Casual Users**: Continuous (Number of casual users)
- **Registered Users**: Continuous (Number of registered users)
- **Total Count (cnt)**: Continuous (Total number of bike rentals)

## Conclusion

This project equips BoomBikes with a better understanding of the factors affecting bike demand. With these insights, they can make informed business decisions and enhance their services in the post-pandemic era. Our model serves as a solid foundation for predicting future bike demand based on various influencing factors.
